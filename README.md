# EE 590a: Data Structures and Algorithms with Python
## Programming Assignment 1

## Getting Started!

Before you get started, you should: 

* Submit the course Intro survey so your Github ID is added to the class on Github
* Install PyCharm

## Overview

This assignment is almost entirely around setting up your accounts and system 
to allow you to do assignments. Apart from that, you'll start to get comfortable working 
with Jupyter notebooks and a little bit of Python. 

## Details

Once your Github repo is ready: 
* Copy the URL to clone your repo 
* Starting PyCharm 
* Select File -> New Project from VCS 
* Past the URL for your repo 
* The IDE will open with the repo
* Open the notebook (HelloWorld.ipynb)
* Use the notebook to create a simple MadLib program
  * See below for an example of MadLibs
* When you are done, commit your code and push it to Github
* Once it's submitted on Github, submit a link to your repo on Canvas

### MadLibs 

If you're not familiar, MadLibs is a simple game. You have a story, and 
ask someone to give you some words. Then, you tell the story with those words 
filling in the blanks. 

Here's an example: 

```
Give me a noun: dog
Give me a color: red
Give me a city in Washington: Tacoma
Give me a noun: apple
The dog really wanted a red kite. So it walked to Tacoma but they were sold out, so it bought an apple instead.
```

To get input from a user in a Jupyter, use the `input()` command: 

```python
name = input()
print("Your name is " + adrienne)
```


## Grading Criteria

The grading criteria for this is pretty light. 
* 25 points: Your assignment is turned in on time, in both Github and Canvas
* 10 points: your program takes in 5 words from the user
* 10 points: Your notebook is nicely organized, and has headings, text cells, and code cells.
* 2 points: Your Github repo shows at least 2 commits 
* 3 points: Flair-- your notebook presents the code nicely, has a fun/interesting story, provides a little delight. 


## Submission

Push your code to Github before the deadline, and submit a link to your Github repo on Canvas. 

## Updates to the assignment - Will announce if you need to do

We may periodically deploy updates to the assignment.
You will need to resolve any conflicts that occur. Please come to office hours if you have any issues. 

If significant changes have been made, we will do our best to send an announcement to the class.
